A short, cute platformer made with PICO-8 inspired by Celeste Classic.


Q: When was this game made?

A: Made sometime during the spring of 2020.

Q: What challenges came about when creating this?

A: Unlike something like Unity, PICO-8 has no built-in physics system or other components games need, which means they must be made from stratch. This was a challenge for me, since I'm used to letting game engines do the maths for me. I had to look back to my physics notes on Kinematics, and figure out how to make the movement not only work well but feel good. Also, PICO-8 uses Lua version 1, which I've never used before. The language is must more leniant compared to C++. This leniancy created a lot of annoying bugs. Another less-technical challenge was art. I've had little experience with art and pixel art before this. I studied and practiced pixel art to create the feeling I wanted IWTJH to have.

Q: Besides Celeste Classic, what other things inspired/ helped you to make this?

A: For art, games like Kirby as well as the pixel artists MortMort (from youtube) and Pedro Medeiros (one of the main artists for Celeste). As for programming, the people who mod Celeste Classic are insane, and were a big inspriation.
